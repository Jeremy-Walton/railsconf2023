## Notes

Always needing to keep up can be stressful. Always be shipping. Burned out people often burn down things. Teams wither and communication suffers. As managers or workers we need to understand burn out. “Always be shipping” turns into “always be slipping” as deadlines pass. Burn down chart is part of SCRUM. Ideal line of amount of work over number of days that goes down until all work is complete. There are other things besides tickets that need to be “burned down”.
