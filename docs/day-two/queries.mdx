# A custom design pattern for building dynamic ActiveRecord queries

The pain is familiar to long-time developers of enterprise Rails applications. Database queries through ActiveRecord are an essential part of our application. And making these queries performant, dynamic, and readable is hard.

## Notes

* Big Picture:
  * Surface Data in Many Systems
  * Filterable, Customizable
  * Fast, Agile innovation
* Acceptance Criteria
  * Composable
  * Maintainable
  * Performant
* Composable
  * Legos
  * Modular: shaped from smaller interchangeable parts
  * Respond to logic & conditionals
  * Return desired fields that might vary by filters selected
* How to avoid messy composable queries?
* OO programming for queries!
* Alternatives?
  * Raw SQL / Contacts
    * Most performant
    * Limited only by RDBMS
    * No dependencies
    * Poor readability
    * Less maintainable
    * Less composable
    * Less linter help
  * Vanilla Active Record
    * Composable
    * More readable
    * Some complexity
    * No conditional branching
  * Arel Tables
    * Deals with complex queries & branching
    * Relational algebra is difficult to read
    * Cannot express multiple concerns in a single node (higher level business logic)
  * Custom design pattern w/ AR
    * Highly composable
    * Conditional branching support
    * OO
    * No complex library needed… you can take it & run
  * Query Builder + Visitor Pattern (called “Builder” pattern)
    * Wraps AR
    * Query classes + Builders + Nodes
    * Initial state
  * Visitor pattern to delegate active record query to each node to continue to build up the state
  * Reduce accumulates nodes and eliminates unnecessary ones via AR.merge(clause) over & over
  * Eg query.merge(Campaign.where(title: title)) if names.present?
  * Give the builder the nodes and let the nodes eliminates themselves
  * A node can contain other nodes
    * or/and where clauses
    * CTE
    * Subqueries
    * Higher business logic
  * Legendary characters (Veteran and Buff)
  * Nesting of nodes
    * Wheres operator with operator (and/or)
  * Best Practices
    * Encapsulate public interface of your query in a class
      * 1 query class per API endpoint (eg IndexQuery)
    * Make it modular
      * Compose it of named classes that represent nodes
    * Delegate to builders and nodes
      * Move the bulk of you rlogic outside of the query class
    * Make a builder that uses the visitor pattern
      * Use a builder abstraction separate from your query class
      * Query class should read descriptively
  * Abstraction Frees our Code to Tell a Story
