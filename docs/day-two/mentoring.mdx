## Notes

* Andy Andrea (Mentor) and Billy Frey (Mentee)
* Not just how to be a good mentor or mentee, but both. Its bidirectional.

- Mentee Problem
  - Under-mentoring: Mentor is too busy and doesn't have time for junior
  - If management doesn't believe you, show the numbers.
    - Mentorship increasing retention by 20%
    - Increase job satisfaction
    - Diversity?
  - Flash mentoring: Spontaneous on-the-job advice.
  - How to deal with under-communicating mentees?
    - Imposter syndrome; social anxiety?
    - Doesn't know how to ask good questions
  - Psychological safety: The belief that you can take interpersonal risk and fail, and that's normal. Problems aren’t “you” that’s wrong, part of being a human.
    - Project Aristotal: Google research to figure out how to make the best team. Concluded that psychological safety was where the buck stopped.
  - Let your mentee *lead*  and facilitate the 1 on 1. Brainstorm what structure is helpful for them.
  - When they run into a problem, help them document the solution-will help them feel like they contributed.
  - Have your mentee pair with you on your problems. Let them see you make wrong decisions and right ones.
  - Practice failure. Mock emergencies. Bring down staging and help mentee to fix it.
- What do mentors get out of it?
  - Improve communication skills. Explain highly technical problems to people with less technical experience. Using the right language is a good exercise.
  - Mentors are 6x more likely to be promoted and 5x more likely to get raises.
  - Satisfaction: Seeing them grow!
- GROW - Goal, Reality, Options, Will. Help mentees to have vision, motivation, and a feeling of excitement on their journey.
- HARVEST - reap the success of what you have learned with boldness (ask for promotion)
- SHARE - share with community
- VARK - Visual Auditory Reading/Writing Kinesthetic
- ZPD - Zone of Proximal Development - the area in which a person cannot progress without another person with a higher skills set to assist.
