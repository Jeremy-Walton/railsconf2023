~4000 Employees
~1400 Controllers. +25% YoY
400,000 lines of ERB
First 6 years no managers,

Be the home for all devs.
> “We believe people with disabilities should benefit from and be able to contribute to the creation of human progress” - Accessibility.GitHub.com

Colorado. Natural disaster. House burned down.

### Chrome has accessible tools in the dev tools

Scanning Forms Previews (Preview Driven Development)

### Scanning
BAD A11Y DOES NOT BREAK CI

Alt text for images. Can check for alt text, but cannot check it is accurately describes it.
Grouping things implies meaning. Blind people don’t see that.
#### ax tool.
Highlights accessibility errors and throws console errors.

#### Intractability
Rethink an entire workflow. GH projects for instance. Drag and Drop

### Forms
Core competency
`form_with` is basically 1to1 with DOM. Not accessible out of the box.

> “Programmatically associate labels with all form controls. The recommended methods is to use the label element and an explicit association using the for and id attributes” - Axe rule 4.4

DEFINE ERRORS OUT OF EXISTENCE. Construct software to make invalid states impossible.
Accessible by… default? Solved with a custom form builder.

#### Accessible Abstractions
E.G. Avatar.
Built a UI Component.

### Previews (Preview Driven Development)
View Component Previews.
Basically like Action Mailer preview but for view components.
Testable.

#### Tools
LookBook (basically storybook). Works for Rails partials
	Built from the ground up for Rails and Hotwire.
	Has accessibility tools built in.
Primer for Github Design System.

### Universal Design
I.E. Curb cuts (for wheelchairs originally, but helps/
Single Sign on avoids Capchas.

> “We also know there are know unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns - the ones we don’t know we don’t know. And if one looks throughout the history […] it is the latter category that tends to be the difficult ones.” -Donald Rumsfeld
