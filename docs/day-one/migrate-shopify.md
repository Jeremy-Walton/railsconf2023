## Notes

This was a deep dive into what is required to change the rails database adapter to Trilogy instead of MYSQL2. The motivation was to move to a more maintained adapter. They ended up pulling this adapter into rails. When deploying Trilogy, they started with 1% and that went well. Then they went to 50%, had issues, and needed to revert.
