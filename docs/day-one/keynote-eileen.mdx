## Notes

Exploring the principles & techniques behind the framework.
Works at Shopify

Originally Tightly coupled. Clear lines between gems
Active model only requires active support.

### Tenants
* Rails is modular but not fractured.
* Rails is designed to have agnostic interfaces.
* Rails  is extracted from applications.
* Rails is made of simple and aesthetic APIs
* Rails is a framework that takes on complexity to empower you

### How Rails Components are structured.

* Action Cable
* Action Pack
* Active Job
* Active Storage
* Action Mailbox
* Action Text
* Active Model
* Active support
* Action Mailer
* Action View
* Active Record
* Railties

Naming Convention
Active vs Action?

Active is backend behavior
Action is user facing
Frailties is the glue between them.

### Architecture
Architecture & Patterns of Rails components
Architecture & Patterns the role of Railties

Application -> Register hooks -> Load components -> Run hooks

### Railties
* Railties are the core of the framework
* Railties control load order ad when hooks should be run
* Enables components to work together without adding dependencies
Look in the components railties for how it is configured.

Architecture & Patterns Agnostic interfaces.
```
model ActiveRecord
  module ConnectionAdapters
    class AbstractAdapter
    end
  end
end
```
Factory pattern with inheritance.
Active storage does this too.
Concrete should inherit from Abstract

### Agnostic Interface
* Consistent interface for all supported libraries
* Simplifies Rails code to avoid using is_a
* Makes it easy for apps to swap out adapters / services
* Lowers the maintenance burden. They maintain the ones they are comfortable with and other can implement the rest

### Metaprogramming

Class eval.
How does the has_many and belongs_to work?

Find the implementation of a method.
`post.method(:comments).source_location`
`Post::generatedAssociationMethods`

* Powerful tools enables us to build beautiful, simple APIs
* Hides complexity from your application
* Where “Rails Magic” comes from

### Maintaining Rails
Why I work on it

* 2010: Introduced to Rails
* 2011: Big Nerd Ranch
* 2014: 1st conference. 1st contribution
* 2015: First RailsConf
* 2017 Join Rails Core
* 2023 This RailsConf

I work on Rails to advance the framework
I work on Rails to ensure applications can stay on Rails
I work on Rails to build a stronger community
I work on Rails have an impact on the future

### Rails is
* Inspiring
* Empowering
* Imperfect
* The applications we build
* The team behind it
* Community
* Magic
