# Using Rails Engines to Supercharge Your Team

Rails engines are self-contained modules that can be used inside of a larger Ruby on Rails application to encapsulate complex functionality and expose it with a tight, well defined API.

## Notes

Story of how Doximity used Rails engines to deploy a sophisticated application.
* Gem is shared Ruby code
* Engine integrates with Rails
* GraphQL is a way to describe data, includes documentation, typed responses, safer changes, unified
* Backend perspective – no internal standard, isolation harder, developer experience was atrocious
* GraphQL Federation (app name) was the answer
* Restored internal standards to backend, isolation, and improved developer experience
* Started with Rails Guides documentation
* Plan approach – setup engine, create GraphQL playground
* Engine is a  mountable plugin
* Focus heavily on dummy application provided as part of test harness
* Make sure dummy app exposes every feature of engine so we don’t have to deploy engine to test changes
* Mount controller action in engine’s internal routes
* Inherit controller from ActionController::Base so that Application doesn’t impact engine
* Includes Authentication by default because it’s not optional
* Includes generators to make installing Engine easier
* Includes RSpec helper
* Includes ActiveSupport instrumentation
* Integrated with CI to monitor schema changes
* Includes Rake tasks
* Uses Railties to provide Rake tasks and update Playground
