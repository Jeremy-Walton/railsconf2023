# Dissecting Rails - a different approach to learning Rails

After evolving for 18 years, I feel Rails is at a stage where it is a bit overwhelming for new developers to get started, because of the surface area of its features.

## Notes

This workshop was very rudimentary and mainly focused on splitting up learning Ruby before learning Ruby on Rails. Also learning independent pieces first like Rack or bundler. The Academy already uses this approach in a much more developed way.
