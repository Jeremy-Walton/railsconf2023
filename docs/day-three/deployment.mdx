## Notes

jordan@headway.io

* Headway (consultancy)
* This talk is for deployment solutions for small teams & apps
* Hatchbox
  * By rails devs, for rails devs
  * Convention over configuration
  * Bring your own servers if you want
  * Eg aws activate ($1k credits) + hatchbox
  * Handles the configuration so you don't have to
  * Rails only
  * From GoRails
  * You can do whatever you want, but rails conventions by default
  * Automatic deploy via webhooks / github
* Fly.io
  * High availability servers that you put close to your users
  * Bare-metal machines configured however you need
  * Very responsive customer support
  * Configurable environments with dockerfiles and customizable deploy process
  * App-platform, not DB focused
  * CLI command to deploy
  * Can work with Github Actions for deployment
* Render
  * Very fast setup
  * Cheapest of the 3
  * Want to replace Heroku as your 1-stop shop for static sites, web apps, DBs, cron, etc.
  * Priced as the lowest cost option
  * Has free tier
  * Automatic deploy via webhooks / github
* Knowledge cost + technical cost + cost cost
* Knowledge cost
  * Who has the experience
  * What are the pitfalls in getting up to speed on [x]?
  * How hard is it to transfer knowledge to the client team?
* Technical cost
  * Is this the best use of the client's budget & trust?
  * How much work is it to maintain the app on [x] host?
  * How much work is needed to scale the product if it takes off?
* Cost cost
* MRSK is another option
* Look for a blog post from these guys and a notion checklist to help you choose for your app
* Heroku priced tiers haven’t changed, so really, for most clients, it works just as well as it did previously… its more of a psychological issue, wherein Heroku’s lack of free tier is an expression of a lack of commitment to give back to the community (hack-a-thons, training programs, etc), and that causes this author to want to look elsewhere.
* Recommends Render for your next free-tier Rails training program (seems closest analog to Heroku free tier)
* What would suggest you should shift from a managed db to an unmanaged db?
  * Dedicated ops team
  * Need to use extensions not supported by the host
  * Foreign data wrappers
